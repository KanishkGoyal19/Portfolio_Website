I worked as a Customer Experience Analyst Coop, where my role focused on supporting customer service teams and ensuring that customers received the best care and experience possible. This work term report gives an overview of my four-month experience at Stryker, highlighting key projects, goals, and the skills I developed.",

      "My primary goal for this work term was to apply my academic knowledge in a practical, beneficial way for the company. I aimed to contribute meaningfully and build relationships that would help me in the future. I worked on various projects, but the overarching theme was using Microsoft Power Platform to create apps, reports, and flows to improve the efficiency of the Customer Service Team.",
      "The Customer Experience Team’s goal was to provide the tools and resources necessary for the Customer Service Team to focus more on their customers, while we handled the background tasks. I wanted to learn as much as I could, not only to survive in the corporate world but to thrive in it.",
      "One of my key goals was to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. By adapting and improvising on the tasks I was given, I used my academic knowledge to create practical solutions that positively impacted both my team and the company.",
      "I wanted to focus on skills that would be valuable in a corporate environment, not just those that looked good on a resume. This led me to work with Microsoft Power Platform tools, such as Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI. These tools are widely used in professional settings and offer various applications that can make work processes smoother and more efficient.",
      "During my term, I also worked on improving my soft skills, like listening to and understanding users' issues, and learning to be patient when working through problems. An essential part of my development was learning how to modify apps, reports, and other solutions to make them user-friendly and practical.",
      "Looking back, I believe I accomplished most of my goals. I developed a strong relationship with my manager and the Customer Service Team, worked on impactful projects, and gained valuable experience in hosting demos, collecting user feedback, and working through iterative improvements. I also learned the complete project timeline—from idea to prototype, to testing, and eventual rollout.",

      "As a Customer Experience Analyst Coop, my role was centered on creating technical solutions to improve the efficiency of the Customer Service Team. One of the main projects I led involved replacing a manual Excel sheet used by the Customer Service and Supply Planner teams with a more modern, automated solution.",
      "The Excel sheet had performance issues due to multiple users accessing it at the same time, causing crashes, lag, and difficulty reading data. I created a Power App connected to SharePoint that included role-based features. This app allowed Customer Service Representatives to raise inquiries, which were then picked up by Supply Planners who could work on the records and send notifications back to Customer Service. This replaced the inefficient Excel sheet and improved the workflow.",
      "Another project I worked on was creating an automated reminder flow. This flow sent weekly reminder emails to Sales Representatives, Managers, and BUDs for orders pending billing. The system matched pending orders to the relevant individuals and sent reminders based on how long the orders had been open. This increased transparency and accountability across teams.",
      "The technical skills I used—Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI—were not directly taught in my academic courses. Instead, I learned them practically through experimentation and testing, applying my coding problem-solving skills to real-world challenges.",
      "Its important to understand that while these projects, may seem small in scope, they had a significant impact on the day-to-day operations of the teams involved. The time saved and the efficiency gained from automating these processes allowed team members to focus more on their core responsibilities, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience.",

      "Looking back, I am grateful for the opportunity to work at Stryker and for the support and mentorship I received. I developed valuable technical and soft skills, contributed meaningful solutions to business problems, and gained a deeper understanding of how technology is used in the corporate world. The skills and experiences I gained during this term will undoubtedly benefit me in my future career endeavors and I look forward to applying what I have learned in upcoming challenges.",
